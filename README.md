DESCRIPTION:
 Chrome Extension for Time Tracking and Productivity Analytics
Task-4 was about developing a Chrome Extension that tracks how much time a user spends on different websites and classifies them as productive or unproductive. The backend script (background.js) runs as a service worker and tracks site activity using chrome.tabs APIs. The frontend (popup.html, popup.js, style.css) displays a breakdown of usage time in a clean popup UI. The time is stored using chrome.storage.local, and users can view real-time productivity stats by clicking the extension icon. Optionally, a dashboard or weekly report could be implemented using Chart.js and Firebase. This task was a deep dive into Chrome APIs, extension architecture, and local data handling â€” ideal for real-world productivity tools.
